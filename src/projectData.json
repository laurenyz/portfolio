Once logged in, users can create posts, create replies, and can upvote replies. Users can also save scratchpads, which they can access in their account along with their published posts. Users can collaborate with others on scratchpad documents by sharing the document's URL. Finally, users can update profile pictures and other account data, which update on the frontend right away and persist in the backend (stored in Cloudinary)."
